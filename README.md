# drawingTool

The repository contains the Umple implementation of a basic drawing tool.
For each aspect of the tool, the model and Java implementation were created separately, by using Umple's mixin feature to implement all functionalities in different files.

The tool supports multiple layer management and basic tool management.

To compile and execute the application, obtain the Umple Compiler from http://dl.umple.org, and run the following commands from the src folder:
